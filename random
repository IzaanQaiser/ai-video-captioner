Alright — here’s a CarterPC-style script for that idea. It opens with a jaw-drop salary reveal, then pivots into a fast-track plan from 0 → software engineer in under 6 months so it’s aspirational and actionable.

⸻

[0–4s: Hook — grab attention with $$]
“Some software engineers are making $400,000 a year… and no, they’re not coding gods. You could go from zero to getting paid like that in under 6 months — here’s how.”

⸻

[4–15s: Reality check & curiosity]
“Before you think it’s impossible — most of those big earners didn’t start at FAANG, they started with skills companies pay stupid money for right now. The game isn’t ‘learn every language under the sun,’ it’s ‘learn exactly what gets you hired fast.’”

⸻

[15–35s: The fast-track roadmap]
	1.	Pick a high-demand track — AI engineering, full-stack web, or cloud/devops.
	2.	Go all-in on projects — skip the calculator apps, build tools people actually use.
	3.	Integrate AI into your workflow — employers are actively looking for engineers who can code and use AI to speed up delivery.
	4.	Show it, don’t just say it — put your projects online with live demos, GitHub repos, and a clean one-pager explaining the problem, your solution, and results.

⸻

[35–50s: Why this works]
“Recruiters don’t hire skill lists. They hire proof. You could grind theory for years, or spend 4–6 months building three killer projects that solve real problems and scream ‘I can deliver’.”

⸻

[50–60s: Closing punch]
“You don’t need 4 years and $80k in debt to be a software engineer. You need the right skills, the right projects, and the receipts to prove it. Do that, and you can be negotiating salaries most people think are impossible — in under 6 months.”

If you want, I can also turn this into a visual salary breakdown (clips, B-roll, pay stub screenshots, Glassdoor charts) so when you drop the $400k line, people stop scrolling instantly.

Do you want me to make that version?
